The Spring Framework is a comprehensive Java-based application framework that follows the Model-View-Controller (MVC) architectural pattern, among others. It is designed around the principles of Inversion of Control (IoC) and Dependency Injection (DI) to enhance modularity, testability, and maintainability of applications. Here's a high-level overview of its architecture:

1. **Core Container**: This is the base module which consists of:
    - **Core**: It provides fundamental parts of the framework such as bean factory and application context.
    - **Beans**: This module provides the foundation for DI where the objects or beans are managed and wired together.
    - **Context**: Builds on top of the Beans module providing extra services like internationalization, event handling, and resource loading.

2. **Aspect-Oriented Programming (AOP)**: Enables aspects to encapsulate behavior that cuts across multiple classes into reusable components. It supports common AOP features like transaction management and declarative caching.

3. **Data Access/Integration**: Provides support for JDBC, ORM tools (like Hibernate and JPA), transactions, and messaging solutions.
    - **JDBC**: Simplifies database access code.
    - **Transactions**: Manages transaction demarcation and synchronization.
    - **ORM**: Integrates with various Object-Relational Mapping frameworks.
    - **Data JPA**: Simplifies the use of JPA for data access.

4. **Web MVC**: Implements the web application model-view-controller pattern. It includes controllers, views, view-resolvers, and interceptors for handling HTTP requests and responses.

5. **Spring WebFlux**: A reactive alternative to Spring MVC, built on Project Reactor, for building non-blocking, asynchronous applications on the server-side.

6. **Spring REST**: Support for building RESTful web services using both Spring MVC and Spring WebFlux.

7. **Testing**: Offers support for unit testing and integration testing through modules like `spring-test`.

8. **Cloud Native**: Modules that facilitate the development of cloud-based applications, including support for configuration management, service discovery, circuit breakers, and more.

9. **Security**: Offers authentication and authorization functionality.

Each of these components can be used independently or combined to build complex enterprise-scale applications. The heart of the Spring Framework is its ability to manage dependencies and lifecycle of different components in an application through IoC and DI, allowing for a loosely coupled architecture.

The Spring Framework is a widely-used Java-based application framework that follows the Model-View-Controller (MVC) architectural pattern, although it supports several other patterns as well. At its core, Spring is designed around the Inversion of Control (IoC) and Dependency Injection (DI) principles to make applications more modular, testable, and maintainable.
