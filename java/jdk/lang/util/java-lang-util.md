The provided code is the source code for the `Comparator` interface in Java. This interface is used to order objects of a specific type. It is found in the `java.util` package.

The `Comparator` interface is a functional interface, as indicated by the `@FunctionalInterface` annotation. This means it has a single abstract method, which in this case is the `compare(T o1, T o2)` method. This method is used to compare its two arguments for order. It returns a negative integer, zero, or a positive integer as the first argument is less than, equal to, or greater than the second.

```java
int compare(T o1, T o2);
```

The `Comparator` interface also includes a `equals(Object obj)` method. This method checks whether some other object is "equal to" this comparator. It must obey the general contract of `Object#equals(Object)`. 

```java
boolean equals(Object obj);
```

The interface provides several default methods that return a new `Comparator` which, in addition to this `Comparator`, also takes into account the order imposed by another `Comparator` or a function extracting a sort key. These methods include `reversed()`, `thenComparing(Comparator<? super T> other)`, `thenComparing(Function<? super T, ? extends U> keyExtractor, Comparator<? super U> keyComparator)`, and others.

```java
default Comparator<T> reversed() {
    return Collections.reverseOrder(this);
}

default Comparator<T> thenComparing(Comparator<? super T> other) {
    Objects.requireNonNull(other);
    return (Comparator<T> & Serializable) (c1, c2) -> {
        int res = compare(c1, c2);
        return (res != 0) ? res : other.compare(c1, c2);
    };
}
```

Finally, the `Comparator` interface provides several static methods that return a `Comparator` that imposes a certain order on objects of a certain type. These methods include `reverseOrder()`, `naturalOrder()`, `nullsFirst(Comparator<? super T> comparator)`, `nullsLast(Comparator<? super T> comparator)`, and others.

```java
public static <T extends Comparable<? super T>> Comparator<T> reverseOrder() {
    return Collections.reverseOrder();
}

public static <T extends Comparable<? super T>> Comparator<T> naturalOrder() {
    return (Comparator<T>) Comparators.NaturalOrderComparator.INSTANCE;
}
```
